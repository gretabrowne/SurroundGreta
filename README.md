# SurroundGreta
Facebook University final project, Surround, a surround-sound system app that enables many phones to play the same track at once. Optimizes channels on each phone based on phone's location in room. Additional "throwing sound" feature lets controller drag finger around circle on screen, which updates the server-- phones use live queries to listen for server updates and change volume of track according to algorithm that relies on phone's individual location and location of controller's finger. This lets controller "throw" or "localize" sound to any part of the space they want. App was selected as the top Android app (out of 20) in the Menlo Park location, and was presented to Mark Zuckerberg in his office.

## Usage
1. Import project from GitHub into Android Studio. Run app on multiple phones to get full functionality.
2. Upon launching app, under Settings set IP address to your server's IP address. Then quit app and re-open. 
3. Choose one phone to be the controller and one or more to be speakers (you can also have multiple controllers!). Select a track, and hear your music play from all of your speaker phones!

Enjoy your Surround experience!
